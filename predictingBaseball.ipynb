    "# **3  Data Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset chosen for this project will be sourced from retrosheets.com and include baseball data from 2010-2018. Retrosheets has a large amount of historical baseball data ranging from 2018 all the way back to 1871. It includes downloadable play-by-play files, complete game logs, and team schedules for all of the years mentioned above. Retrosheets also has multiple regular season game log files compiled into a zip archive that can be downloaded in bulk. This project will be using those compiled game files for seasons from 2010 through 2018. The initial format of the data is a simple text file, however all fields are in comma delimited format so conversion to a CSV file will not cause a problem. These files contain the most complete and most relevant data to solve the problem and include information such as team statistics, winning and losing pitchers, linescores, attendance, starting pitchers, umpires and more. In total the dataset has close to 46,000 rows and 161 variables that will need to be processed, below is a detailed listing of all variables:\n",
