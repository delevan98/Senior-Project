# Predicting the Outcomes of Baseball Games Using Machine Learning Approaches

# Overview

This project aims to predict the outcomes of baseball games using machine learning approaches AKA POBGUMLA. The predictions that will be made is the winner of the game (Win/Loss) and the score for both the home team and the away team. The project will collect historical data from Retrosheet.com and scrape data from Baseball-Reference.com. This data will then be cleaned, processed, and feature engineered to wrangle data into a form that will enhance machine learning model performance. Once this step has been completed the data will be fed into regression and classification models to train and test them. Once the highest
